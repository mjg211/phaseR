Description: Performs a qualitative analysis
   of one and two dimensional autonomous ODE systems, using phase
   plane methods. Programs are available to identify and classify
   equilibrium points, plot the direction field, and plot trajectories
   for multiple initial conditions. In the one dimensional case, a 
   program is also available to plot the phase portrait. Whilst in the
   two dimensional case, programs are additionally available to plot 
   nullclines and stable/unstable manifolds of saddle points. Many 
   example systems are provided for the user.
